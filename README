# - if April then month of April
# - if April 15 to May 20 then that range

## Future Improvements

- Long Term Product: For long term considerations, we plan to switch
  to a structure involving postgresql, multiple users, fastapi, and authorization.

- This is a significant overhaul that includes converting the format
  and storage method for saving the data to postgresql and redesigning
  the application for FastAPI and postgresql.

- For instance, we aim to narrow the room column display to accommodate a detail pane,
  auto-generate room calendars from sales records, implement room lists for each hotel
  based on a site id, and other improvements.

TODO: remove redundant save_calendar_files(df, month): from calendar_management
