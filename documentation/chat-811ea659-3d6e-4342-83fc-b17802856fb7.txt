Explain the following Python code:

```python
# TODO add a method for removing or editing events
# TODO validate date range when adding events to ensure the start_date is before the
#  end_date, events can span across months
# TODO what happens if an event is already scheduled in a room on a given day, see flips
# TODO: in event spans only use event_name in beginning cell
import pandas as pd

Assistant: 
The provided Python script represents a simple event calendar program for booking rooms. Let's break it down:

The program start by importing the necessary library (pandas). Pandas is used for handling and manipulating structured data, like the calendar in this case.

The `EventCalendar` class is created to manage the events and their details such as the month of the event, rooms available, and the events themselves. 

This class has three methods:

1. `__init__(self, month)`: The constructor method initializes the calendar with the month specified.

2. `initialize_calendar(self)`: This method initializes the calendar dataframe with dates from 1 to 31 as indices and rooms as the columns. The number of days can be adjusted for different months. `pandas.DataFrame` is used to create the calendar.

3. `add_event(self, event_name, start_date, end_date, rooms)`: This method allows you to add an event to the calendar. It takes in the event name, start and end date of the event and the rooms where the event is supposed to take place. It checks for the validity of the rooms and the dates given. If the rooms and dates are valid, it proceeds to add the event to the calendar dataframe for the given range of dates in the specified rooms. If room is already booked or the date is out of range, it provides proper messages and skips to the next.

You may need additional auxiliary methods to specify user inputs and to display and save your event calendar. These are not included in the provided script but are hinted in the provided related methods.
