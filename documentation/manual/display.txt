Explanation of the code:

The provided Python code snippet includes a function definition and some imports. Here is a brief explanation of the code:

1. The 'webbrowser' and 'os' standard library modules are imported.

2. The function 'display_in_browser' is defined, which accepts a single parameter, 'file_path'. This parameter represents the path to a file on the system.

    def display_in_browser(file_path):
        webbrowser.open('file://' + os.path.realpath(file_path))

This function is used to open a file in a web browser. It creates a URL to the file by concatenating 'file://' with the absolute path to the file, obtained using os.path.realpath(file_path). The 'realpath' function returns a canonical path (i.e., an absolute path with all symbolic links resolved). This prepared URL is opened in a new browser window via 'webbrowser.open()'.

Below is some elaboration about the additional attached Python code:

The main method is the starting point of the program which asks for user input regarding event details and room availability, updates a calendar based on the user input, and saves the calendar data.

Several utility functions are used to interact with the user and operate on the calendar and event data. There is also a 'EventCalendar' class which encapsulates the operations on a calendar object, like adding an event.

In the end, after doing all operations specified by the user, the resultant DataFrame is saved and displayed in the browser by using 'display_in_browser' method. This method will open a webpage that shows the final calendar event data.
